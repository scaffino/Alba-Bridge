# LN-bridge

A proof-of-concept implementation to evaluate a bridge protocol from the Lightning Network to Ethereum. Only the case "Verify Current Latest State" is implemented.

This project uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started) to compile, run, and test the smart contracts on a local development network.
