# LN-bridge

Proof-of-Concept of a bridge protocol from the Lightning Network to Ethereum. Only the variant "Verify Current Latest State" is implemented.

This project uses [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started) to compile and run the smart contracts on a local development network.
